# Magic wand
by Albert Guedj and Ludovic Blanc

## Question you propably think about

*What does it do ?*

It creates different structures in minecraft-pi


*How does it work ?*

when the wand with a metal piece touches another piece of metal on the box it calls a function depending which piece we touched


*Are the functions always similar ?*

No there is button on the magic wand to select options for the functions


*What function exists ?*

For now there is a function creating a mine and another transforming block around the player like King Midas.


*What do I do if I've got an idea of function ?*

You can write to us and it can probably help us to have other ideas!!
